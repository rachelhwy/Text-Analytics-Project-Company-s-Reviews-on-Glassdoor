# Descriptions

We collected reviews from Glassdoor.com and did analysis to know more about the companies culture and working environment. 
Our goal was tring to know a specific word for that company. For example, indeed has a tag of "good management". One easy way to do this 
is word frequency, basically counting the words and chosing the highest frequency. The other one is LDA (topic modeling).
